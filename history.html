      	   <h4>History</h4>
  		       <p>FIRST Robotics Competition Team 4918, also known as The Roboctopi, is a FIRST Robotics Team based in Port Townsend, Washington. It was created in 2014 under the mentorship of Austin Henry, an engineer at Atlas Technologies, and in partnership with the Northwest Maritime Center. The rookie team was made up of a core of about a dozen students, most of which would go on to stay with the team until graduating. Returning team members would serve as helpful leaders to newcomers, allowing them to adjust and learn about the complexities of FRC. In 2015 a retired Navy avionics engineer, Darrin Newlander, joined the team as a mentor. The Roboctopi stayed in the Northwest Maritime Center for two years before moving into a private shop. After suffering a major robbery in 2016, the team decided to reach out to the community for a new space to work in. The team eventually settled in a new home at the Port Townsend High School Robotics and Technology Lab, also becoming a 4-H affiliated program and being joined by parent and new mentor Brian Morningstar. The team continues to reside in the PTHS lab and works hard to foster an environment of learning and creativity among its team members.</p>
  		       <h4>2014</h4>
  		       <p>2014 was our rookie year. The 2014 game challenge was Aerial Assist, a game that required the manipulation and throwing of large inflatable yoga balls. The team settled on building a pneumatic catapult, utilizing the standard FIRST drive base. Our robot was named Buster. (Image of CAD Model). Our first event was the Glacier Peak Qualifier. We had limited success in qualifies, going 4-8 in our matches. However, we were selected for eliminations, going 1-2 in Quarterfinals. Nevertheless, we were able to win the Rookie Inspiration Award, and learned about and fixed crucial design flaws in our intake. At our next event, Mount Vernon, we had improved our robot so much that we placed first in the rankings going 11-1, and thus won the Highest Rookie Seed Award. In the playoffs, we went 2-0 in Quarterfinals and got into the Semifinals where we lost 0-2, still resulting in us winning the Rookie All Star Award. Because of our performance at both of our regional events, as well as the awards we won, we got to go to the District Championship, where we went 5-7 and finished in 47th place.</p>
  		       <h4>2015</h4>
  		       <p>Our next year was a game called Recycle Rush. Recycle Rush was a challenge about stacking large grey totes and garbage cans. As such, we decided to make a robot that was essentially a giant elevator for totes. Our robot, Mad Stacks, was built on a custom mecanum drive train to maneuver through the towers  of totes on the field. Our first event was the West Valley Qualifier. Our robot was equipped with an onboard microprocessor, allowing for us to program a field oriented drive system. With this, we were able to earn the Excellence in Engineering Award, as well as being picked for an alliance into the Elimination round. We we went as far as the Semifinals before we lost to the opposing squad of robots. Our next event was the Mount Vernon Qualifier. There, we finished rank 12, also advancing to Eliminations but not making it past the Semifinals. With our success at our Qualifying events, our team moved on to the District Championship, where we placed 28th, which put us in a position to go to the World Championships.</p>
  		       <h4>2016</h4>
  		       <p>Looking for good info and a video.</p>

  		       <h4>2017</h4>
  		       <p>Our last year, which was a game called FIRST Steamworks, our team went back to winning plenty of awards. That year&#146;s game had two main objectives. Most teams that year went for one; we went for the other. At our first event, which was Mount Vernon, we were the only robot which could do this second task. Additionally, when our robot systems broke, they automatically tried to fix themselves, and this resulted in us winning the Innovation in Control Award. At the following event, which was Auburn, we improved so much that we were ranked third and got to pick our partners. We won the finals, thus getting our first &#147;blue banner&#148; and another award, called District Event Winner. Like Recycle Rush, our team was just barely on the outside, but thanks to those awards, we got to Worlds.</p>

  		       <p>In the future, we hope to try for the more prestigious awards, such as the Engineering Inspiration Award and Chairman&#146;s Award.This may be difficult, but we are certain it is accomplishable.</p>
